Multi-Class Logistic Regression with MNIST.

In Octave run the file ./logistic_regression/multiclass. This script will train and classify data and it will output a file results.csv. Please, if you want to submit to Kaggle, first add a row with ImageID and Label in results.csv before the data as Kaggle expects the file in that format.

Check my blog for the post explaining about this algorithm.
